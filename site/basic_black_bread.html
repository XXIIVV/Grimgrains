This bread is super light and fluffy, it's great great for morning toast or sandwiches.</p><p>I've been reading up a lot about bread, there's so many kinds out there. I wanted to understand how the ingredients we add, can change the texture of the bread. Also read about the differences in temperature, to knead or not to knead etc.</p><p>Truth is, it depends on the type of bread you want.</p><p>I wanted to make a sandwich bread with a light crumb, the kind that bounces back when touched.</p><p>The one I made this time has more fat, which in turn makes it softer and fluffier. The fat that you use will also change the texture/taste of the bread. A lot of people wont like the idea of adding 'fat' to a recipe, know that fat isn't synonymous with unhealthy. Too much of it can be bad, but in moderation there really isn't anything to worry about. It also depends on what fat you choose, there are good and bad kinds of fat.</p><p>There are many things you can do to help soften your bread, like brushing the outside with a little oil or fat. Do this as soon as you take it out of the oven, it will make the outside less crunchy. You can also substitute nut milk for the water, if you want a richer taste. There are so many different things to think about when baking!</p><p>I made this loaf for a brunch I had with friends, we wanted to have fondue with a set I got as a gift during the holidays. We  cut the loaf into cubes, and dunked them in! Soft bread is perfect for fondue!</p><p>So there you have it! A basic black bread!</p><p><b>Burger buns:</b> Repeat steps 1 to 6 in the recipe below.

Keep adding flour a <u>60 g (1/2 cup)</u> at a time, until the dough stops sticking to the sides.</li><li>Put ball of dough on lightly floured counter-top and start kneading, add a bit of flour everytime it starts to stick to your hands. Knead for <u>15 minutes</u>. You may not use up all of your flour, if there's still a lot left and your dough is nice smooth don't add any more. Don't want to risk drying it out.</li><li>Heat up oven at the very lowest setting.

Cover with a cloth and place in oven. <i>Let rise for 45 minutes</i>.</li><li>Your bread should have doubled in size. Take bread out of oven, knead a few times and shape into a 25-28 cm cigar-shape. Sprinkle some <a href='corn_semolina.html'>corn semolina</a> on a baking sheet and place bread on top - this will keep it from sticking.

Cover loaf with a cloth, put back in oven to rise for an additional <u>45 minutes</u>. If you don't want a traditional bread shape, put bread in a greased loaf pan to rise.</li><li>Turn oven up to <u>180 °C (350 °F)</u> .
